                                                Chapter 5 Overview: UNIX File System Basics

Purpose of Chapter 5
    Introduces the file structure of UNIX.
    Acts as the first part of a two-chapter discussion (Chapter 8 continues this topic).

Key Topics Covered
      Basic concepts of files and directories
      Explains what files and directories are and how they function.
      Hierarchical tree structure
      Shows how files and directories are organized in UNIX in a tree-like hierarchy.

Terminology
      Defines the key terms used in the UNIX file system (like inode, root directory, parent/child directories, etc.).
      File system manipulation commands
      Introduces commands to create, move, delete, and manage files and directories.
      
Naming conventions
      Discusses rules for naming files and directories (case sensitivity, allowed characters, etc.).
Practical exercises
      Provides terminal exercises to demonstrate commands and file system navigation.


5.1 Disk Organization

      UNIX organizes the hard disk into directories (units) and subdirectories (nested units).
      Directories can contain other directories, creating a hierarchical structure.

UNIX provides commands to:

      Create directories
      Organize directories and files
      Track files on the disk

5.2.1  File Types under UNIX
    UNIX classifies files into three main types:

Regular Files
      Contain sequences of bytes.
      Can be program code, data, text, or other content.
      
Directory Files
      Store information about other files (e.g., file names).
      Contain multiple records in a special system-defined format.

Special Files (Device Files)
      Represent peripheral devices such as printers, disks, etc.
      Contain device-specific information to interface with the hardware.


5.2.2 In a UNIX file system, the terms parent and child are used to describe the hierarchical (tree-like) structure of directories:

      The root directory (/) is at the top of the hierarchy.
    → It has no parent and is the ancestor of all directories.
    
    Every other directory is a child of some parent directory.
    → For example:
              /home/user/Documents
      Or as the same as I can say like that 
└── home
    └── user
        └── Documents
      
      In short:
                  Parent directory → contains one or more child directories or files
                  Child directory → resides inside a parent directory
                  Root directory → the only directory without a parent

5.3.1.0 Important Directories in the UNIX File System
    1. / (Root Directory)
    
        The top-most directory in the UNIX file system hierarchy.
        All other directories and files branch from it.
        Acts as the starting point (or base) of the directory tree.
            Example /
            ├── usr
            ├── bin
            ├── etc
            ├── dev
            └── tmp
