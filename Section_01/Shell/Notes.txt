  It covers the following key topics:

Variables – How to create, assign, and use variables in shell scripts to store data (like numbers, strings, filenames, etc.).

Flow Control –How to control the flow of execution in shell scripts using constructs such as:

  if, else, elif (conditional branching)
  for, while, until loops

case statements (for multi-branch selection)
    Creation of Shell Scripts – How to write and save a shell program (usually with a .sh extension) and make it executable.
    Running Shell Scripts – How to execute shell programs from the command line using commands like:

      sh scriptname.sh
      ./scriptname.sh

Debugging –
How to identify and fix errors in shell programs using options like:
    
    sh -x scriptname.sh (to trace execution)
    echo statements (to print variable values and track flow)
