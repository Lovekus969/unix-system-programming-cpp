The UNIX operating system is organized into three main layers, forming a layered-style software model.Each layer has specific responsibilities and interacts only with the layer directly above or below it.
  1. Kernel (Core Layer) Also called: Base Operating System
      Role: Acts as the core of UNIX — it manages hardware resources and system operations.
      Functions:

                Process management (creation, scheduling, and termination)
                Memory management
                File system management
                Device management (through device drivers)
                System calls (interface between user programs and hardware)

Note: The kernel runs in privileged mode and directly interacts with the hardware.

2. Resident Modules Layer (Service Layer) Role: Provides essential service routines that the user or shell requests.
  Functions:
        Manages input/output operations
        Handles file access and manipulation
        Provides utilities for process control
        Note: This layer acts as a bridge between the kernel and the user interface, ensuring that user commands are executed properly by calling kernel routines when necessary.

3. Utility Layer (User Interface Layer) Also known as: The Shell Role: Serves as the UNIX user interface.

Functions:
        Accepts user commands
        Interprets and passes them to the operating system
        Displays the output or results to the user
        Examples of shells:
        Bourne Shell (sh)
        C Shell (csh)
        Korn Shell (ksh)
        Bash (bash)

Key Features of UNIX

                  Multitasking: UNIX allows multiple tasks (processes) to run simultaneously.
                  Example: You can edit a file, compile a program, and print documents at the same time.
              
              Multiuser System: Multiple users can log in and use the system at once, each having their own environment and permissions.
                  This makes UNIX ideal for servers and shared systems.
              
              Portability: Written mostly in the C language, making it easy to modify and run on different hardware platforms.
                  Security and Protection: UNIX uses file permissions (read, write, execute) and user authentication to protect data.
                  Permissions are set for owner, group, and others.
              
              Hierarchical File System
                  Organizes files in a tree-like structure starting from the root directory (/).
                  Makes file organization, searching, and management efficient.
              
              Shell (Command Interpreter)
                  The shell acts as a user interface — it interprets user commands and communicates with the kernel.
                  It also supports shell scripting for automation.
              
              Device Independence
                  All hardware devices (printers, disks, terminals) are treated as files, making access uniform and simple.
              
              Networking Capabilities
                  UNIX supports communication between systems over networks using standard protocols (TCP/IP).
              
              Utilities and Tools
                  Comes with a large set of powerful built-in utilities for file manipulation, text processing, and system management.
                  Example: grep, awk, sed, find, tar, etc.
              
              Pipelining and Redirection
                  The output of one command can be used as input to another command using pipes (|).
                  Redirection (>, <, >>) controls where input and output go.
              
              ✨ Summary (One-line Definition)
              
              UNIX is a portable, multiuser, multitasking operating system with a hierarchical file system, powerful security features, and rich command-line utilities.


UNIX Utilities
        The UNIX system provides a rich collection of utility programs, also known as commands, that help users perform everyday tasks efficiently.
Definition
        The UNIX system includes more than 100 utilities (commands).
        These utilities are an essential part of the standard UNIX system and are designed to perform a wide range of user-level functions.
        Each utility performs a specific function, and multiple utilities can be combined using pipes and redirection to create powerful operations.
