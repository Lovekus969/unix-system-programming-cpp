The UNIX operating system is organized into three main layers, forming a layered-style software model.Each layer has specific responsibilities and interacts only with the layer directly above or below it.
  1. Kernel (Core Layer) Also called: Base Operating System
      Role: Acts as the core of UNIX â€” it manages hardware resources and system operations.
      Functions:

                Process management (creation, scheduling, and termination)
                Memory management
                File system management
                Device management (through device drivers)
                System calls (interface between user programs and hardware)

Note: The kernel runs in privileged mode and directly interacts with the hardware.

2. Resident Modules Layer (Service Layer) Role: Provides essential service routines that the user or shell requests.
  Functions:
        Manages input/output operations
        Handles file access and manipulation
        Provides utilities for process control
        Note: This layer acts as a bridge between the kernel and the user interface, ensuring that user commands are executed properly by calling kernel routines when necessary.

3. Utility Layer (User Interface Layer) Also known as: The Shell Role: Serves as the UNIX user interface.

Functions:
        Accepts user commands
        Interprets and passes them to the operating system
        Displays the output or results to the user
        Examples of shells:
        Bourne Shell (sh)
        C Shell (csh)
        Korn Shell (ksh)
        Bash (bash)
