                                                              Chapter - 03     Starting a UNIX Session

This chapter focuses on the basic interaction between the user and the UNIX operating system, from logging in to logging out, and introduces essential commands for beginners.

1. Logging In and Logging Out
                To start a UNIX session, a user logs in by entering a valid username and password.
                Logging in allows access to the UNIX shell — the command-line interface where users can type commands.
                To end the session, users log out using the logout or exit command, which safely terminates their session.

2. Passwords and Security

                Passwords protect each user’s account from unauthorized access.
                Users are encouraged to create strong passwords and can change them using the passwd command.
                UNIX hides passwords for security reasons (not shown on screen while typing).

3. Command Line Format

                Commands in UNIX follow a specific format:
      For example:- >> 
                  command [options] [arguments]

4. Basic UNIX Commands

                ls – Lists files and directories
                pwd – Displays the current working directory
                cd – Changes the current directory
                mkdir – make a new directory
                rmdir – Removes a directory
                cat – Displays file contents
                date – Shows the current date and time

5. Correcting Typing Mistakes

                UNIX allows editing commands directly on the command line:
                Use Backspace to delete characters.
                Use Ctrl + U to erase the entire line and start over.

6. Establishing Contact with UNIX

            When a user logs in, the system starts a login shell, loads configuration files (like .profile or .bashrc), and prepares the environment for command execution.
            The shell interprets user commands, executes them, and displays results.

7. Internal UNIX Operations

            UNIX handles tasks through processes, input/output redirection, and file management internally.
            Each command runs as a separate process, and UNIX efficiently manages these processes in the background.

3.1: Establishing Contact with UNIX
              The process of establishing contact with the UNIX operating system involves a series of prompts and user inputs that mark the beginning and end of a session.

What is a UNIX Session?
              A session is the period of time during which a user interacts with the computer system after logging in and before logging out.
              During a session, the user can execute commands, create or modify files, and communicate with the system.


    Login Name
              When a user account is created in UNIX, both a login name (also known as User ID or Username) and a password are assigned.

Key Points:

              Your User ID is unique — it identifies you to the UNIX system and distinguishes you from all other users.
              It allows the system to manage your personal files, permissions, and access settings securely.
              The User ID and password together form your credentials for accessing the system.

Logging In Process:

When the UNIX system displays the login prompt, type your User ID and press [Return] (or Enter).

                                    login: david


The system then displays a password prompt:

                                    Password:


Type your password carefully — nothing will appear on the screen as you type (for security reasons).

If both the login name and password are correct, UNIX grants you access and displays the shell prompt (e.g., $ or %), indicating that you can now enter commands.


                                  login: david
                                  Password: ********
                                  $
                    Here,
                    
                    david → is the User ID.
                    ******** → represents the hidden password.
                    $ → indicates that the user is successfully logged in and the system is ready for commands.

Meaning of $ in UNI
                The $ symbol is called the shell prompt.
                It appears on the screen after you successfully log in to the UNIX system.

What It Means

                The $ prompt means the system is ready to accept your commands.
                It’s like UNIX’s way of saying:
                “I’m waiting — you can type your next command now.”



Different Prompts for Different Shells
              The symbol may vary depending on which shell you are using (a shell is the command interpreter in UNIX):

                  | Shell Type                    | Prompt Symbol | Example         |
                  | ----------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
                  | **Bourne Shell (sh)**         | `$`           | `$ ls`          |
                  | **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)** | `$`           | `$ pwd`         |
                  | **C Shell (csh)**             | `%`           | `% date`        |
                  | **Superuser (root)**          | `#`           | `# rm file.txt` |

Password
          A password in UNIX is a sequence of letters, digits, or special characters used to verify a user’s identity and ensure that only authorized individuals can access the system.

Key Points:
          
          The password acts as a security measure that protects your account and data from unauthorized use.
          Each user must have a valid login name (User ID) and password to access the system.
          Passwords are case-sensitive, meaning uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently.
