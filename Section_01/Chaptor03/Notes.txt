                                                                  Starting a UNIX Session

This chapter focuses on the basic interaction between the user and the UNIX operating system, from logging in to logging out, and introduces essential commands for beginners.

1. Logging In and Logging Out
                To start a UNIX session, a user logs in by entering a valid username and password.
                Logging in allows access to the UNIX shell — the command-line interface where users can type commands.
                To end the session, users log out using the logout or exit command, which safely terminates their session.

2. Passwords and Security

                Passwords protect each user’s account from unauthorized access.
                Users are encouraged to create strong passwords and can change them using the passwd command.
                UNIX hides passwords for security reasons (not shown on screen while typing).

3. Command Line Format

                Commands in UNIX follow a specific format:
      For example:- >> 
                  command [options] [arguments]
