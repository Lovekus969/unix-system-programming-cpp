What is UNIX?

UNIX is a multiuser, multitasking operating system originally designed for computers and servers. It’s known for its stability, security, and portability, meaning it can run on many types of hardware with minimal changes.


It provides essential system services like:
    
        File management
        Process management
        Memory management
        Device management
        Command-line utilities

Many modern operating systems — like Linux, macOS, Android, and even parts of Windows — are inspired by or based on UNIX principles

Who made UNIX (and who uses it now)?
   Originally developed by AT&T Bell Labs, UNIX later spread to universities, research institutions, and   companies.
    Over time, several organizations created their own versions (distributions) of UNIX, such as:

        AT&T System V
        BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) – University of California, Berkeley
        Sun Microsystems – created Solaris
        IBM – created AIX
        HP (Hewlett-Packard) – created HP-UX
        Apple – based macOS on BSD UNIX

Today, UNIX-like systems (such as Linux and macOS) dominate servers, data centers, and developer environments.
