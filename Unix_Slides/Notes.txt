What is UNIX?

UNIX is a multiuser, multitasking operating system originally designed for computers and servers. It’s known for its stability, security, and portability, meaning it can run on many types of hardware with minimal changes.


It provides essential system services like:
    
        File management
        Process management
        Memory management
        Device management
        Command-line utilities

Many modern operating systems — like Linux, macOS, Android, and even parts of Windows — are inspired by or based on UNIX principles
