What Are Control Structures?
    Control structures control the flow of execution in a program — that is, the order in which instructions are run.
    There are three main types of control structures:

    Sequence
    
    Selection
    
    Iteration (not insertion)

Sequence Structure
    This is the default way code runs — one statement after another, from top to bottom.
    Example (in Java or C++):


Selection Structure (Decision Making)
    Used when you need to choose between options.
    Common keywords: if, else if, else, switch.

Iteration Structure (Loops)

  Repeats a block of code multiple times until a condition is false.
  Common loops: for, while, do-while.

Example:
      
      for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
          System.out.println("Count: " + i);
      }
