What Are Control Structures?
    Control structures control the flow of execution in a program — that is, the order in which instructions are run.
    There are three main types of control structures:

    Sequence
    
    Selection
    
    Iteration (not insertion)

Sequence Structure
    This is the default way code runs — one statement after another, from top to bottom.
    Example (in Java or C++):


Selection Structure (Decision Making)
    Used when you need to choose between options.
    Common keywords: if, else if, else, switch.

Iteration Structure (Loops)

  Repeats a block of code multiple times until a condition is false.
  Common loops: for, while, do-while.

Example:
      
      for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
          System.out.println("Count: " + i);
      }
1️⃣ What is an Assignment Statement?
        An assignment statement is used to store a value into a variable.


What is c += 4?
       
        This is called a compound assignment operator.
        It is a shortcut for adding a value to a variable.  ( Read + write +Add) 


CPython — The Standard Python Implementation
    Python as a language has many implementations:
        CPython (the most common) ✅
                PyPy
                Jython
                IronPython
            
            CPython is the reference implementation of Python.
            It is written in C — the interpreter that runs your .py files is C code
