What Is an Expression in C?

  An expression is anything in C that produces a value.
  Think of it like math + logic + variables combined.

Why Expressions Matter?

Because every line of C code is built from expressions.
FAANG interviews often ask you to predict the output of expressions using:

    operator precedence
    increment/decrement
    logical operators
    arithmetic
    assignment
    Understanding expressions = writing correct and bug-free code.

Types of Expressions in C
1️⃣ Arithmetic Expressions

Use +, -, *, /, %

int x = 10 + 20;   // 30
int y = x * 2;    


2. Relational Expressions

Check true/false relationships.

int a = 5 > 3;   // 1 (true)
int b = 10 == 20; // 0 (false)

3️⃣ Logical Expressions

Use &&, ||, !

int ok = (age >= 18) && (hasID == 1);

4️⃣ Assignment Expressions

Use =, +=, -=, *=, etc.

x += 5;   // same as x = x + 5;

5️⃣ Increment / Decrement Expressions

Use ++ or --

i++;   // post increment
++i;   // pre increment

6️⃣ Conditional (Ternary) Expression

Shortcut for if-else.

result = (age >= 18) ? 1 : 0;
