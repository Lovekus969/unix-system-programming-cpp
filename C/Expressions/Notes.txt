What Is an Expression in C?

  An expression is anything in C that produces a value.
  Think of it like math + logic + variables combined.

Why Expressions Matter?

Because every line of C code is built from expressions.
FAANG interviews often ask you to predict the output of expressions using:

    operator precedence
    increment/decrement
    logical operators
    arithmetic
    assignment
    Understanding expressions = writing correct and bug-free code.
