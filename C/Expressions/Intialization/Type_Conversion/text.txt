What Is Type Conversion in C?

Type Conversion means changing one data type into another.

Example: converting int → float, char → int, etc.

It happens in two ways:

      1️⃣ Implicit Type Conversion (Automatic / Type Promotion)
      
      C converts automatically when needed.
      
      2️⃣ Explicit Type Conversion (Casting)
      
      You force the conversion.
