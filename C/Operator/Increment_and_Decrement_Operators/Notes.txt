Increment & Decrement Operators in C
  These are unary operators — they operate on a single variable.

    Increment Operator: ++
    Adds 1 to a variable.

Two Types: Pre and Post
1️ Prefix (Pre-increment / Pre-decrement)
    Happens before the value is used.
    
        ++x → increments first, then uses the value
        
        --x → decrements first, then uses the value

Postfix (Post-increment / Post-decrement)
  Happens after the value is used.
  
      x++ → uses the current value, then increments
      x-- → uses the current value, then decrements
