Logical Operators in C
Definition

    Logical operators are used to combine or invert conditional expressions (true/false statements) in C.

They always return either:
    
    1 → True
    
    0 → False
    
    Logical operators are mostly used in decision-making, loops, and complex conditions.

Why We Use Logical Operators

    To check multiple conditions together.
    Example: "If age > 18 and has permission → allow access."

    To invert a condition using NOT (!).
    Example: "If it is not raining, go outside."
    
    To make complex decisions readable and concise.
    In loops, to combine multiple stopping/continuing conditions.

When We Use Logical Operators

    Conditional Statements: if, else if, switch
    Loops: while, for, do-while
    Boolean Expressions: Combining multiple comparisons
    FAANG-level code: Checking multiple criteria efficiently in one line
