C String Functions (with simple explanations)
1. strlen(char *str)

  Returns the length of the string (number of characters before \0).
  Does NOT count the null terminator.
2. strcpy(dest, src)

  Copies the entire string from src to dest including \0.
  dest must have enough memory.

3. strncpy(dest, src, n)

  Copies at most n characters.
  If src is smaller than n, padding happens with \0.
  Safer than strcpy.
