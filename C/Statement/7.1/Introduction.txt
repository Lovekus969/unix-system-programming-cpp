What Are Statements in C?

A statement is a complete instruction that tells the C compiler what to do.

Why Statements Matter (FAANG Level)

FAANG interviewers check:

      how you control flow
      whether you understand scope
      logical thinking
      clean, structured code
      correct use of loops and conditions



#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    int a = 5;               // assignment expression statement
    int b = 3;

    int c = a + b;           // arithmetic expression statement
    int d = (a * b) + 10;    // complex expression

    a++;                     // increment expression
    b--;                     // decrement expression

    printf("a = %d\n", a);
    printf("b = %d\n", b);
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    printf("d = %d\n", d);

    printf("Function call is also an expression!\n");

    return 0;                // jump statement
}




What is an if statement?
      The if statement allows your program to make decisions.
It checks a condition:
      
      If condition is true (non-zero) → code inside the block runs
      If condition is false (zero) → code is skipped
