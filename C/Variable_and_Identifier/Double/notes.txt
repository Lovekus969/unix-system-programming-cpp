Data Type: double
Numbers with decimal parts can be represented using the double data type.

For example, 32.9, -56.5, 9.0, etc., can all be represented by the double data type.

As we learnt earlier, %d is the format specifier for the int data type. Similarly, %lf is the format specifier for the double type.

Let's see a program that declares and prints a double variable:

Data Specifier Table
| Data Type           | Format Specifier | Example                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| `int`               | `%d`             | `printf("%d", age);`       |
| `float`             | `%f`             | `printf("%f", height);`    |
| `double`            | `%lf`            | `printf("%lf", distance);` |
| `char`              | `%c`             | `printf("%c", letter);`    |
| `string` (`char[]`) | `%s`             | `printf("%s", name);`      |

Q. What is the size of double in C on different systems?

Question:
What is the size of a double on a 32-bit system and a 64-bit system? Is it always 8 bytes?

Concept tested: memory model, IEEE-754, portability.

Answer:
Typically 8 bytes (64 bits) on both systems, but C standard does not guarantee it.
FAANG cares about whether you know it's platform-dependent.

NaN, +∞, and −∞ in C (IEEE-754 Floating-Point)

C uses the IEEE-754 standard for floating-point numbers (float, double).
This standard defines special values:

🔶 1. NaN (Not a Number)
Meaning:

NaN represents an undefined or unrepresentable value.

Common ways to produce NaN:

0.0 / 0.0

sqrt(-1.0)

log(-5.0)

Any operation involving an existing NaN

Properties of NaN:

NaN != NaN (this is important!)

Any mathematical operation with NaN → NaN

%f prints it as:
nan (case varies: may show NaN, nan, or -nan)
