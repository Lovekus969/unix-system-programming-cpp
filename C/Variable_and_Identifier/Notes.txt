Printing a Variable
Just like we use printf() to print words or numbers, we can also use it to print the value of a variable.

But when printing a variable, we need to tell printf() what kind of data the variable holds (like a number, a decimal, or text). We do this using something called a format specifier.

Each data type has an associated format specifier.

For example, if we have an integer variable age and we want to print it, we'll use the format specifier %d.

                    #include <stdio.h> — gives access to printf().
                    %d — is a format specifier used for integers.
                    printf() — prints the formatted string to the console.
                    Always end your statement with a semicolon ;.
                    return 0; — signals successful program completion.
