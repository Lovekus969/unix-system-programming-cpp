What is a Structure in C?
A structure is a user-defined data type that allows you to combine data items of different kinds. Structures are used to represent a record of related information.

Why useful?
    Organizes data neatly
    Used in system-level programs (file system, networking, OS)
    Foundation for linked lists, trees, queues, etc.

Typedef
    Definition:
    typedef creates a nickname/alias for a data type.

Unions
    Definition:
    A union is like a structure, but all members share the same memory.
. Bitwise Operators

Used to manipulate individual bits of data.
    
    Operators:
    
                    & AND
                    | OR
                    ^ XOR
                    ~ NOT
                    << left shift
                    >> right shift

                    Hardware programming
                    Flags and masks
                    Permissions
                    Compression
                    Fast arithmetic
