In large real-time systems (Google servers, databases, OS kernels, self-driving car systems, telecom systems), you must keep data organized, consistent, and safe.

If you pass too many individual parameters around instead of grouping them in a struct:

Why using STRUCT prevents crashes
  1. Struct groups related data together
  Passing 10 separate arguments increases the chance of an error.

2. Struct ensures memory layout is consistent

  Real-time systems depend on fixed memory layout.
  The layout of a struct is predictable, well-aligned, and optimized by the compiler.
  If your system expects a specific memory format (e.g., a network packet, sensor data), and you pass random parameters separately, you can corrupt the memory.

3. Structs avoid stack overflow

  Passing too many arguments uses too much stack.
  Structs use one pointer, so memory usage stays small and constant.

4. Structs allow atomic updates

  In multi-threaded systems:
  Updating one field at a time is dangerous.
  Updating the entire struct at once is safe.

5. Structs make APIs stable

  Large companies like Google maintain APIs used by thousands of developers.
  If they passed 8 parameters and then needed to add 2 more → all code breaks.
  But with structs:
    You can add new fields without breaking old code.
