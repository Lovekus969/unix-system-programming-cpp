In large real-time systems (Google servers, databases, OS kernels, self-driving car systems, telecom systems), you must keep data organized, consistent, and safe.

If you pass too many individual parameters around instead of grouping them in a struct:

Why using STRUCT prevents crashes
  1. Struct groups related data together
  Passing 10 separate arguments increases the chance of an error.

2. Struct ensures memory layout is consistent

  Real-time systems depend on fixed memory layout.
  The layout of a struct is predictable, well-aligned, and optimized by the compiler.
  If your system expects a specific memory format (e.g., a network packet, sensor data), and you pass random parameters separately, you can corrupt the memory.

3. Structs avoid stack overflow

  Passing too many arguments uses too much stack.
  Structs use one pointer, so memory usage stays small and constant.
