What are pointers in c 
  Q1What are Pointers?
  Pointers are variables that store memory addresses instead of values. They "point" to where data lives in memory.

The Core Analogy: Pointers are ADDRESSES
  Think of your computer's memory as a giant street with millions of mailboxes. Each mailbox:
      Has a unique address (memory address)
      Can hold some content (data)
  A pointer is simply a piece of paper that writes down an address, NOT the content itself.
