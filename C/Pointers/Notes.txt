What are pointers in c 
  Q1What are Pointers?
  Pointers are variables that store memory addresses instead of values. They "point" to where data lives in memory.

The Core Analogy: Pointers are ADDRESSES
  Think of your computer's memory as a giant street with millions of mailboxes. Each mailbox:
      Has a unique address (memory address)
      Can hold some content (data)
  A pointer is simply a piece of paper that writes down an address, NOT the content itself.


Basic Data Types in C with Sizes
1. Integer Types
| Data Type            | Size (bytes) | Typical Range                       | Format Specifier |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `char`               | 1            | -128 to 127                         | `%c`, `%d`       |
| `unsigned char`      | 1            | 0 to 255                            | `%c`, `%u`       |
| `short`              | 2            | -32,768 to 32,767                   | `%hd`            |
| `unsigned short`     | 2            | 0 to 65,535                         | `%hu`            |
| `int`                | 4            | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647     | `%d`             |
| `unsigned int`       | 4            | 0 to 4,294,967,295                  | `%u`             |
| `long`               | 4 or 8       | Platform dependent                  | `%ld`            |
| `unsigned long`      | 4 or 8       | Platform dependent                  | `%lu`            |
| `long long`          | 8            | Very large range (±9.22e18 approx.) | `%lld`           |
| `unsigned long long` | 8            | 0 to 1.84e19 approx.                | `%llu`           |

2. Floating-Point Types
| Data Type     | Size (bytes) | Precision (approx.)  | Format Specifier |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| `float`       | 4            | 6–7 decimal digits   | `%f`             |
| `double`      | 8            | 15–16 decimal digits | `%lf`            |
| `long double` | 10–16        | Platform dependent   | `%Lf`            |
3. Void Type
| Data Type | Size (bytes) | Description                                                                                                   |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `void`    | 0            | Represents “no value” — used for functions that return nothing, or for pointers to untyped memory (`void *`). |
