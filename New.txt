C is a general-purpose programming language that has been widely used for over 50 years.

C is very powerful; it has been used to develop operating systems, databases, applications, etc.
 Role of C in the Unix C Language

    The kernel (core of Linux) is primarily written in C.
        Why C?

            Portability: Can run on different hardware architectures.
            Efficiency: Produces fast, low-level machine code.
            Control: Allows direct memory and hardware manipulation.
2. Assembly Language

       Only a tiny part of Linux uses assembly.
       Usually for bootstrapping the system, handling hardware interrupts, or CPU-specific instructions.
