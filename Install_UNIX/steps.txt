🧹 Step 1: Uninstall Old Virtual Machine

Open VirtualBox.
      
      Select your existing UNIX / OpenBSD VM from the list (on the left side).
      Click Machine → Remove (or right-click → Remove).
      Choose “Delete all files” so that it removes all virtual hard disks too.
      Once done, exit VirtualBox.

💾 Step 2: Reinstall VirtualBox (Optional but Recommended)

      If your VirtualBox has errors or version issues:
      Uninstall VirtualBox from your system.
        Go to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
      .

Download and install the latest version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

📥 Step 3: Download UNIX (OpenBSD ISO)
    Use one of these two ISO images:

✅ Latest (recommended):
https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/7.7/amd64/install77.iso

🧩 Older stable version (7.1):
https://mirrors.ucr.ac.cr/pub/OpenBSD/7.1/amd64/install71.iso

After downloading, rename the file to:
Unix-OpenBSD.iso

and place it somewhere easy to find (like Desktop or Downloads folder).
