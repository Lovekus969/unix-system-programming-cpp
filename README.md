# unix-system-programming-cpp
Learning journey into C++ and Unix System Programming. Covers core C++ concepts, memory management, OOP, STL, and dives into system-level programming including file I/O, processes, signals, multithreading, and interprocess communication on Linux.



# Unix & System Programming in C++

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository tracks my learning journey in **C++** and **Unix System Programming**.  
It covers everything from **C++ basics** to **system-level programming concepts** like processes, signals, threads, and IPC.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- `C++_Basics/` â†’ Core C++ (pointers, memory, OOP)
- `STL/` â†’ Practice with Standard Template Library
- `Unix_Basics/` â†’ File I/O, processes, signals
- `Advanced/` â†’ Multithreading, IPC
- `Notes/` â†’ Roadmaps, Linux commands, syscall references

---

## ðŸ“… Roadmap
- Week 1: C++ basics & OOP
- Week 2: STL & templates
- Week 3: Unix commands + compiling in Linux
- Week 4: System calls, fork/exec, pipes
- Week 5: Signals & multithreading
- Week 6: IPC (pipes, message queues, shared memory)

---

## âš¡ Skills Practiced
- C++ Fundamentals (memory, OOP, STL)
- Linux commands & shell scripting
- System calls: `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `fork()`, `exec()`, `signal()`
- Multithreading (pthreads)
- Interprocess Communication (pipes, shared memory, message queues)
